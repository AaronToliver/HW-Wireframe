	<h1>Wire Fox Terrier</h1>
	<p>It's not really my favorite animal, but a friend of mine majoring in Yungian psychology says that's what represents me. He's basically psychic so I believe him. Don't know if it was meant as a compliment or an insult, but I'm gonna take it as a compliment, because that's what a wire fox terrier would do.</p>

	<h2>Cool Coats</h2>
	<p>Every wire fox terrier (male or female) looks like it has a three piece suit on... SUIT UP!</p>

	<h2>Energy</h2>
	<p>Wire fox terriers have boundless energy. When focused they can achieve a lot, like winning competitions. When unfocused they can cause destructions, like tearing up yo stuff. <b>Just like yours truly.</b></p>
